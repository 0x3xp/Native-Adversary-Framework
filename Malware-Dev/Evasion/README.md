📂 Evasion: Defensive Bypass & Stealth
❓ Why this folder?
In a modern security environment, code execution is only half the battle. This directory contains the logic and research required to bypass AV (Antivirus) and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions. It focuses on breaking static signatures, evading heuristic analysis, and masking behavioral patterns.

📦 Structure
Payload_Obfuscation/: Tools for encrypting and encoding shellcode to break static detection.

Behavioral_Evasion/: Techniques like API Hooking bypasses, Sleep Obfuscation, and Call Stack Spoofing.

Notes/: Summarized research and cheat sheets for various defense bypass methods.

📓 Summarized Notes (Inside /Notes)
This sub-directory contains high-level summaries for quick reference:

Static_Analysis.md: Techniques to reduce entropy and hide strings.

Dynamic_Analysis.md: Bypassing sandboxes using environmental keying (checking for CPU cores, RAM, and specific hardware IDs).

EDR_Bypass.md: Notes on direct syscalls, unhooking ntdll.dll, and using Heaven's Gate.

🛠️ Key Techniques Implemented
Direct Syscalls: Bypassing user-land EDR hooks by communicating directly with the Windows Kernel via assembly ordinals.

Shellcode Encryption: Utilizing XOR and AES-256 to ensure payloads remain encrypted in memory until the moment of execution.

PPID Spoofing: Masking the parent-child relationship of processes to blend in with legitimate system activity.
