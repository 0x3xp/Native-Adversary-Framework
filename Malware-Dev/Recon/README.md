# System Reconnaissance and Enumeration

### Why this folder
Information gathering is the first step of any successful operation. This folder contains tools designed to profile the target environment, identify users, and detect security software without triggering high level alerts.

### What is included
* **Host_Profiler.cpp**: A tool to gather system architecture, OS version, and hardware specifications using the Win32 API.
* **User_Enum.cpp**: Logic to identify the current user, group memberships, and active sessions to determine the level of privilege.
* **Network_Discovery.c**: Lightweight code to enumerate network adapters, IP addresses, and active connections.
* **Environment_Check.cpp**: Anti-Sandbox logic that looks for virtual machine artifacts and debugger windows to ensure a safe execution environment.

### Key Learning
The focus here is on utilizing built in Windows APIs rather than external commands like whoami or netstat which are often monitored by EDR solutions.
