# Payload Delivery & Staging

### ❓ Why this folder?
Modern malware rarely carries its full weight in the initial file. This folder focuses on "Stagers" or "Droppers"—small binaries that pull down or extract the actual malicious payload onto the target.

### 📦 What's included?
* **Dropper_Stager.c**: A C-based stager that fetches a secondary binary/payload and saves it to a hidden or temporary directory.
* **Execution Flow**: Logic that handles the transition from downloading the file to executing it via the Injection module.
