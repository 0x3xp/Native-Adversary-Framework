# Process Injection Techniques

### ❓ Why this folder?
Injection is the art of moving code from a suspicious process to a trusted one (like `notepad.exe` or `explorer.exe`). This folder explores different ways to achieve code execution in remote process memory.

### 📦 What's included?
* **Classic_Injection.cpp**: Implementation of the `OpenProcess` -> `VirtualAllocEx` -> `WriteProcessMemory` -> `CreateRemoteThread` workflow.
* **Memory Protection Logic**: Research into shifting memory permissions (e.g., from `PAGE_READWRITE` to `PAGE_EXECUTE_READ`) to evade scanners.
