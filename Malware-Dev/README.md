# 02. Malware Development & Offensive Engineering

A collection of modules demonstrating how malware interacts with the Windows OS. These implementations focus on the Win32 and Native API (NTAPI) to achieve stealthy execution.

## 🛠 Key Areas
- **Process Injection:** Methods for migrating code into legitimate processes (Process Hollowing, Thread Hijacking).
- **Stealth & Evasion:** Bypassing EDR hooks using direct syscalls and manual Export Address Table (EAT) parsing.
- **Discovery:** Implementing reconnaissance logic to identify domain users, network shares, and active services.

## 📁 Content
- `/Injection`: Code for `NtMapViewOfSection`, `SetThreadContext`, etc.
- `/Evasion`: Implementations of API Hashing and Anti-Debugging checks.
- `/Recon`: Host and Network enumeration modules.
- `/Delivery`: Payload delivery modules.
