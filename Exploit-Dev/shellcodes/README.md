# x64 Shellcode Lab

### ❓ Why this folder?
To understand how software vulnerabilities are exploited, one must understand how to write instructions directly for the CPU. This folder focuses on writing Position-Independent Code (PIC) using x64 Assembly.

### 📦 What's included?
* **CMD_Spawn.asm**: Custom assembly code to locate `kernel32.dll` via the PEB and execute `WinExec("cmd.exe")`.
* **PEB_Walker.asm**: Low-level stubs to manually find the base addresses of loaded modules without calling Windows APIs.
* **Opcodes Research**: Documentation on identifying and removing null-bytes (`0x00`) to ensure shellcode stability in memory.
