# 01. Exploit Development Lab

This directory contains research into memory corruption vulnerabilities and post-exploitation payload development. The primary focus is on bypassing modern Windows mitigations via manual instruction control.

## 🛠 Key Areas
- **Position-Independent Shellcode:** Crafting x64 assembly that executes regardless of its location in memory (Zero-offset/Relative addressing).
- **ROP (Return-Oriented Programming):** Bypassing Data Execution Prevention (DEP) by chaining existing gadgets in executable memory.
- **Null-Byte Evasion:** Techniques to eliminate `0x00` bytes to ensure payloads are compatible with string-based buffer overflows.

## 📁 Content
- `/Shellcoding`: Custom x64 ASM stubs (e.g., PEB-Walking API resolvers).
- `/Buffer-Overflows`: POCs for stack-based overflows.
