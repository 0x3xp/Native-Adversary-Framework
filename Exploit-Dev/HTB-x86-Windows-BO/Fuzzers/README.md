# 📂 Fuzzers

This directory contains initial discovery scripts used to identify the crash threshold of the target application.

## 🔍 Purpose
Fuzzing is the first step in the exploit development lifecycle. These scripts send progressively larger buffers of data to specific input fields or commands to trigger a memory corruption (crash).

## 🛠️ Typical Workflow
1. Connect to the target IP and Port.
2. Send a buffer of "A"s (starting at 100 bytes).
3. Increment the buffer by 100 bytes until the application stops responding or x32dbg catches an access violation.
4. Record the approximate length of the buffer that caused the crash.



## 📝 Usage
Run these scripts while the target application is attached to **x32dbg**.
