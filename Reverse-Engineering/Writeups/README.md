# Reverse Engineering Writeups

### ❓ Why this folder?
Reverse engineering is the "investigation" phase. This folder documents the process of taking a compiled binary apart to understand its hidden logic, identify security flaws, or bypass checks.

### 📦 What's included?
* **Logic_Analysis.md**: Step-by-step reports on tracing binary execution flow using x64dbg and Ghidra.
* **PE_Header_Breakdown**: Analysis of specific Portable Executable headers and how they can be manipulated to hide code.
* **Bypass Documentation**: Writeups on patching binary instructions to subvert authentication or debugger-detection logic.
